## Building SA Tools from source
After cloning the repository, build in either Debug or Release mode for x86 or x64. After the build has completed, run the program `buildSATools.exe` in the solution's root folder. The files will be located in the `output` folder. You could specify a different location as a command line argument for `buildSATools.exe`, e.g. `buildSATools D:\SATools`.

Alternatively, you could open individual tools from Visual Studio by starting a new Debug instance. Only Debug builds are supported in this mode.
